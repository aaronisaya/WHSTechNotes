Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

I chose option 1 as my journal prompt. In my opinion I think the new phone ban is useless and just unnecessary. I also think that the new phone ban is just going to make kids more sneakier. I see assistant principals enforce the new law during lunch more than I see teachers enforcing it during class. I think I'm doing pretty well following the new law but I still believe that we should atleast be able to have our headphones/earbuds in. Me personally I focus better with my music playing so that's why I think they should atleast allow headphones/earbuds. I also just think it'll be more work for the teachers because they'll have to remember to give the phone back and take care of it.

The career I want to pursue and do is software engineering. Computer science is a big part of software engineering because most of the work in software engineering requires computer science. Software engineering deals with computers and technology a lot so knowing computer science well help in the future. You have to design, create, and maintain software systems with technology so knowing computer science is really helpful. You can't become a software engineer without knowing computer science.

We all know climate change is a real world problem, but we still don't really help to stop it or reduce it, so my idea is using AI to analyze vast amounts of environmental data to predict climate change and identify ways to reduce it or completely stop it. This helps reduce the amount of heat strokes every year. Did you know that each year there is atleast 60,000 people who end up in the emergency room due to having a heat stroke. I came up with this idea by something that happened to my grandpa when he was out working. He died due to a heat stroke and ever since I've been thinking of a way to help others who also work out in the heat. This idea could help people all over the world including construction workers, welders, and just people in general who work out in the heat.

Earning real money for working a virtual store can be good and bad. If the virtual store is actually helping humans in the real world well then workers earning real money is a good thing. But if the virtual store is just a false store that doesn't help humans in any way in the real world then its a bad idea. People working for a virtual store could make them inactive in the real world and just make them lazy. There is also benefits to this including helping people who need jobs but don't have time to go in person gain money and help them have a way to earn money. So there are both pros and cons to IKEA making this decision.

The phrase "6, 7" doesn't really have a meaning, it's just a meme that was created. Students use it usually when a teacher says "6, 7". Ex: John has a competition in 6 or 7 days. Students usually say 67 in a happy mood. It’s rarely said when somebody is sad. The phrase "6, 7" is used so commonly in school, it’s a part of school culture.

  If I was in charge of my school, I would allow phones during lunch and during passing periods but not in class so that students pay attention in class. I would allow headphones like airpods all day because me personally I focus better with music. I would also allow AI because sometimes I struggle with a certain topic and the teacher doesn't really explain it well so I have to use AI to teach me. I think certain games should be unblocked like learning games because it helps students learn while also having fun. All these policies would make students enjoy school more and they might actually want to be there.

My prompt was made to help 9th graders understand pythagorean theorem better and get a better grasp of what it is. Canva AI created a "game" around pythagorean theorem and used questions and a score to motivate the "player". The sliders that canva ai created works really well, as well as the questions. The sliders surpised me because I thought it was going to make a different type of game. I could be more specific and add more details to get exactly what I want. Being good at prompt engineering could really help get exactly what you want and what you're looking for.

If I could invent something cool to help, I would make something called the Safe-Spot Signal. It would be a small, bright green device that you stick on the outside of your house next to your door. When a disaster is happening and you're safe inside, you just press a big button on the device. It has a super-strong battery and doesn't need Wi-Fi or electricity from the street. When you press the button, it sends a special, super-far signal into the sky that just says, "We're Safe Here!" Then, when the rescue workers are driving around in their trucks after the storm, they have a special map that shows all the green dots. They won't waste time checking houses that already signaled they are okay, so they can go way faster to the places with no signal, which means people there really need help. It would be an easy way to save time and make sure that no one is forgotten.

It’s a huge deal that SNAP ran out of money because millions of families, especially kids and older people, can't afford essential groceries, meaning they could go hungry. This is terrible and makes food banks super crowded. Technology can help by using simple apps that immediately show you on a map which local food banks and free meal programs are open and have food available right now. Delivery apps could also use their drivers to bring emergency food boxes to people who are sick or can’t leave their house. The main problem is the digital divide because not everyone has a smartphone or reliable internet connection, which makes it hard for them to even use the apps. If I were the designer, my tool would be called Food Finder SMS. You would just text your ZIP code, and it would text you back instantly with the addresses of the three closest places giving out food to make sure everyone can get help fast.

Technology is completely changing how we spend the holidays, which is both good for connecting with people far away and bad for the people right here. The evidence shows that lots of families use video calls and texting to talk to relatives who live super far away, which is awesome for sharing the fun moments. However, the downside is that new phones and games are a huge distraction that make it harder to focus on the people you are actually with. This constant distraction really makes the quality of immediate family time worse. Since everyone is using tech during the holidays, I think the people who make these apps and toys should be responsible for keeping our privacy safe and making sure we spend time together. The reason for this is that developers could add things like a special "family mode" or better privacy settings that would help limit distractions and let us be truly present with our families.

Real estate photographers use drones to create "advertisments" for properties that real estate agents are selling. This helps real estate agents show potential customers a tour of the house through their phone. Coding helps the drone to safely navigate the property without crashing into anything. These real estate "photographers" earn about 63,000 a year (according to google). You need to have a FAA certification for drone work. I would want to do this job in the future, this job just seems fun flying drones around a house and avoiding obstacles just seems fun to me.
