Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

I chose option 1 as my journal prompt. In my opinion I think the new phone ban is useless and just unnecessary. I also think that the new phone ban is just going to make kids more sneakier. I see assistant principals enforce the new law during lunch more than I see teachers enforcing it during class. I think I'm doing pretty well following the new law but I still believe that we should atleast be able to have our headphones/earbuds in. Me personally I focus better with my music playing so that's why I think they should atleast allow headphones/earbuds. I also just think it'll be more work for the teachers because they'll have to remember to give the phone back and take care of it.
