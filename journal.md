I chose option 1 as my journal prompt. In my opinion I think the new phone ban is useless and just unnecessary. I also think that the new phone ban is just going to make kids more sneakier. I see assistant principals enforce the new law during lunch more than I see teachers enforcing it during class. I think I'm doing pretty well following the new law but I still believe that we should atleast be able to have our headphones/earbuds in. Me personally I focus better with my music playing so that's why I think they should atleast allow headphones/earbuds. I also just think it'll be more work for the teachers because they'll have to remember to give the phone back and take care of it.

The career I want to pursue and do is software engineering. Computer science is a big part of software engineering because most of the work in software engineering requires computer science. Software engineering deals with computers and technology a lot so knowing computer science well help in the future. You have to design, create, and maintain software systems with technology so knowing computer science is really helpful. You can't become a software engineer without knowing computer science.

We all know climate change is a real world problem, but we still don't really help to stop it or reduce it, so my idea is using AI to analyze vast amounts of environmental data to predict climate change and identify ways to reduce it or completely stop it. This helps reduce the amount of heat strokes every year. Did you know that each year there is atleast 60,000 people who end up in the emergency room due to having a heat stroke. I came up with this idea by something that happened to my grandpa when he was out working. He died due to a heat stroke and ever since I've been thinking of a way to help others who also work out in the heat. This idea could help people all over the world including construction workers, welders, and just people in general who work out in the heat.

Earning real money for working a virtual store can be good and bad. If the virtual store is actually helping humans in the real world well then workers earning real money is a good thing. But if the virtual store is just a false store that doesn't help humans in any way in the real world then its a bad idea. People working for a virtual store could make them inactive in the real world and just make them lazy. There is also benefits to this including helping people who need jobs but don't have time to go in person gain money and help them have a way to earn money. So there are both pros and cons to IKEA making this decision.

The phrase "6, 7" doesn't really have a meaning, it's just a meme that was created. Students use it usually when a teacher says "6, 7". Ex: John has a competition in 6 or 7 days. Students usually say 67 in a happy mood. It’s rarely said when somebody is sad. The phrase "6, 7" is used so commonly in school, it’s a part of school culture.

  If I was in charge of my school, I would allow phones during lunch and during passing periods but not in class so that students pay attention in class. I would allow headphones like airpods all day because me personally I focus better with music. I would also allow AI because sometimes I struggle with a certain topic and the teacher doesn't really explain it well so I have to use AI to teach me. I think certain games should be unblocked like learning games because it helps students learn while also having fun. All these policies would make students enjoy school more and they might actually want to be there.
