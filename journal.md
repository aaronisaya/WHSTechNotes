I chose option 1 as my journal prompt. In my opinion I think the new phone ban is useless and just unnecessary. I also think that the new phone ban is just going to make kids more sneakier. I see assistant principals enforce the new law during lunch more than I see teachers enforcing it during class. I think I'm doing pretty well following the new law but I still believe that we should atleast be able to have our headphones/earbuds in. Me personally I focus better with my music playing so that's why I think they should atleast allow headphones/earbuds. I also just think it'll be more work for the teachers because they'll have to remember to give the phone back and take care of it.

The career I want to pursue and do is software engineering. Computer science is a big part of software engineering because most of the work in software engineering requires computer science. Software engineering deals with computers and technology a lot so knowing computer science well help in the future. You have to design, create, and maintain software systems with technology so knowing computer science is really helpful. You can't become a software engineer without knowing computer science.
